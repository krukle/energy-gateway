\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Aims of the project}\label{sec:aims}
The aim of this project is to develop a reliable system for provisioning and over the air (OTA) updates for ESP32 microcontroller units. Specifically, the system should be designed to make the initial setup and connection of the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network as easy as possible, using Bluetooth and a mobile device. It should also be capable of reliably updating the binary of the ESP32 over the air, without interrupting any critical tasks that reads and writes over the serial connection.

\subsection{Structure}\label{sec:structure}
This report is structured as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background} provides a brief overview of the ESP32 microcontroller unit, Wi-Fi provisioning, Over The Air updates, UART, social background and previous research. Section~\ref{sec:method} describes the system that was developed for this project. Section~\ref{sec:results} presents the results of the system. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the results, possible improvements and problems and section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the report.
