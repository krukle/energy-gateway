\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Aims of the project}
\label{sec:aims}
The aim of this project is to develop a reliable system for provisioning and over the air (OTA) updates for ESP32 microcontroller units. Specifically, the system should be designed to make the initial setup and connection of the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network as easy as possible, using Bluetooth and a mobile device. It should also be capable of reliably updating the firmware or binary of the ESP32 over the air, without interrupting any critical tasks that the unit may be currently running.

\subsection{Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
This report is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:background} provides a brief overview of the ESP32 microcontroller unit, and the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocols. Section \ref{sec:system} describes the system that was developed for this project. Section \ref{sec:results} presents the results of the system, and Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the report. // Written by Co-pilot.
